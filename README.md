SceneAssembler
==============

This utility allows assembly of stl files and obj files (files that describe 3D printable objects) into one larger stl file under mouse control.  A tool in its infancy.  

To run it, you need to have the Processing language installed.  Just put all the files in your Processing directory under a directory named TripleD and open up the TripleD.pde file with Processing, run it, and follow the text directions displayed in the window that pops up.
